# Riemann-surfaces-as-components-of-sheaves-of-germs-of-analytic-functions
Expository research in complex analysis conducted under [Shunyu Wan](https://math.virginia.edu/people/sw6vm/) through the University of Virginia Department of Mathematics' [Directed Reading Program](https://math.virginia.edu/drp/). Follows the approach in John B. Conway's [Functions of One Complex Variable, 2nd ed.](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4612-6313-5) (Springer 1978) of defining Riemann surfaces as components of sheaves of germs of analytic functions, as opposed to the conventional definition in terms of the manifold structure.
