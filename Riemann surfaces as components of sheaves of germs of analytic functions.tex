\begin{center}
	Riemann Surfaces as components of sheaves of germs of analytic functions
\end{center}

\section*{Abstract}
Following the path of John B. Conway's \textit{Functions of One Complex Variable}, 2nd ed. (Springer 1978), we construct an unconventional definition of a Riemann surface as a component of a sheaf of germs of analytic functions on an open subset of the complex plane. We compare this definition to the conventional definition of a Riemann surface as a connected complex manifold of complex dimension one.

\section{Introduction}
\indent\indent 
To quote Henri Poincar√©, ``Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things."

We assume basic knowledge of calculus, analysis, the complex numbers, and topology.

We will use ``iff" as an abbreviation for ``if and only if." We will use the symbol ``$\equiv$" to denote that two functions are equal on a given domain, e.g. ``$f\equiv g$ on $G$" signifies that $f(z) = g(z)$, $\forall z\in G$. We will use the symbols ``$\subset$" and ``$\supset$" to denote proper subsets and supersets, respectively, and will use the  symbols ``$\subseteq$" and ``$\supseteq$" to denote subsets and supersets that may be improper.

\section{Proof}
We assume basic knowledge of calculus, analysis, the complex numbers, and topology.\\

\begin{definition}
	Let $G$ and $H$ be subsets of $\cs$ such that $H$ is open and $H\subseteq G$. We say that $f:G\ra\cs$ is \textbf{analytic} on $H$ iff $f$ is continuously differentiable on $H$.
\end{definition}

Note that we can only define a function to be analytic on an open set. While it makes sense to claim that a function is differentiable at a point, that function must be differentiable in some neighborhood of that point in order to be analytic at that point. The impossibility of considering the analyticity of a function on a singleton set will motivate our use of germs later on.

Many sources use ``holomorphic" instead of ``analytic" in order to avoid confusion, as ``analytic" can refer to any function equal to a power series, while ``holomorphic" also specifies that the function maps between subsets of $\cs$. We will not get into the miraculous fact that any function that is analytic, as defined here, is also analytic in the broader sense of being equal to a power series.

\begin{definition}
	We define a \textbf{region} as an open connected subset of $\cs$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	We define a \textbf{component} of a set $X$ as a maximal connected subset of $X$. 
\end{definition}

E.g., $A\subseteq X$ is a component of $X$ iff $A$ is connected and there does not exist a connected subset of $X$ that contains $A$ as a proper subset. The sole component of a connected set is the set itself.

\begin{definition}
	We define a \textbf{function element} to be an ordered pair $(f, G)$, where $f$ is a function that is analytic on the region $G$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	Let $(f, G)$ be a function element. Choose $a\in G$. We define the \textbf{germ of} $\boldsymbol f$ \textbf{at} $\boldsymbol a$, denoted $[f]_a$, to be the collection of all function elements $(g, D)$, where $a\in D$ and $f\equiv g$ in some neighborhood of $a$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
	For function elements $(f, G)$ and $(g, D)$ and $a\in G\cap D$, $(g, D)\in [f]_a$ iff $(f, G)\in [g]_a$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	To show the forward direction of implication, suppose that $(g, D)\in [f]_a$. Then $g\equiv f$ on some neighborhood of $H$ of $a$. Reflexively, $f\equiv g$ on $H$, so $(f, G)\in [g]_a$. The backward direction of implication is shown analogously.
\end{proof}

Note that there is no notion of equality between germs at different points, e.g. we cannot say that $[f]_a = [f]_b$, for function element $(f, G)$ and distinct $a, b\in G$. However, we can intuitively define equality between germs at the same point as occurring iff the two germs contain the same collections of function elements.

\begin{definition}
	Let $\gamma:[a, b]\ra\cs$ be a continuous function, where $[a, b]\subset\rs$. We define the \textbf{path} $\boldsymbol{\gamma:[a, b]\ra\cs}$ to be the image $\gamma([a, b])$.
\end{definition}

We will only be concerned with the path as a subset of $\cs$, so this conflation of the function $\gamma$ and the path $\gamma$ will not cause any issues.

\begin{definition}
	Let $\gamma:[0, 1]\ra\cs$ be a path. Suppose that, $\forall t\in[0, 1]$, there exists a function element $(f_t, D_t)$ for which $\gamma(t)\in D_t$. Suppose that, whenever $|s-t|<\delta$, $\gamma(s)\in D_t$ and $[f_s]_{\gamma(s)} = [f_t]_{\gamma(s)}$, for some $\delta > 0$. We define the \textbf{analytic continuation of} $\boldsymbol{(f_0, D_0)}$ \textbf{along} $\boldsymbol\gamma$ to be $(f_1, D_1)$.
\end{definition}

In our discussion of analytic continuation, we will always suppose that there exists an analytic continuation for the given function element and the given path. To quote Conway, ``Since no degree of generality can be achieved which justifies the effort, no existence theorems for analytic continuations will be proved."

\begin{definition}
	Let $\gamma:[0, 1]\ra\cs$ be a path from $a$ to $b$. Let $\{(f_t, D_t) : t\in[0, 1]\}$ be an analytic continuation. We define the \textbf{analytic continuation of} $\boldsymbol{[f_0]_a}$ \textbf{along} $\boldsymbol\gamma$ to be $[f_1]_b$.
\end{definition}

In order to make this definition unambiguous, we will need to show that it does not depend on the choice of analytic continuation.

\begin{lemma}
	content...
\end{lemma}

\begin{proposition}
	Let $\gamma:[0, 1]\ra\cs$ be a path from $a$ to $b$. Let $\{(f_t, D_t): t\in[0, 1]\}$ and $\{(g_t, B_t): t\in[0, 1]\}$ be analytic continuations of $[f_0]_a=[g_0]_a$ along $\gamma$. In particular, $[f_1]_b = [g_1]_b$, i.e. two analytic continuations along the same path that start at the same germ must end at the same germ.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	Let $T = \{t\in[0, 1]:[f_t]_{\gamma(t)} = [g_t]_{\gamma(t)}$. $[f_t]_{\gamma(0)} = [f_0]_a = [g_0]_a = [g_t]_{\gamma(t)}$, so $0\in T$. In particular, $T$ is nonempty, so we can show that $T = [0, 1]$ by showing that $T$ is both open and closed in $[0, 1]$.\\\\
	To show that $T$ is open in $[0, 1]$, choose $t\in T$. By definition of analytic continuation, $\exists\delta>0$ such that $\gamma(s)\in D_t\cap B_t$, $[f_s]_{\gamma(s)} = [f_t]_{\gamma_s}$, and $[f_s]_{\gamma(s)} = [f_t]_{\gamma_s}$ whenever $|s-t|<\delta$. Let $H$ be a connected subset of $D_t\cap B_t$ containing $\gamma(s)$ and $\gamma(t)$. Since $t\in T$, $[f_t]_{\gamma(t)} = [g_t]_{\gamma(t)}$, so $f_t\equiv g_t$ on $H$. It follows that 
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
	\normalfont
	Let $(f, G)$ be a function element. We define the \textbf{complete analytic function obtained from} $\boldsymbol{(f, G)}$ to be the collection $F$ of all germs $[g]_b$ for which there exists $a\in G$ and a path $\gamma:[0, 1]\ra\cs$ from $a$ to $b$ such that $[g]_b$ is the analytic continuation of $[f]_a$ along $\gamma$.

	Base space of a complete analytic function
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
	\normalfont
	Let $F$ be a complete analytic function with base space $G$. Let $R = \{(z, [g]_z) : [g]_z\in F\}$. Let $S(G) = \{(z, [f]_z) : z\in\cs\text{, }f\text{ is analytic at }z\}$. Let $\rho:S(G)\ra\cs$ be the projection map defined by $(z, [f]_z)\mapsto z$. We define the \textbf{Riemann surface of} $\boldsymbol F$ to be the pair $(R, \rho)$.
